## Background

This *application* exists as a project for __C2C *Elite 101*__ to see where I am as a programmer

## Install

These are the steps to setup your local environment to run this application.

## Usage

If where you access this is somewhere you can *run* code, just run it and this **basic** chatbot (if you can even call it that) will begin attempting conversation. Fair warning, it's *really* bad at conversing.
